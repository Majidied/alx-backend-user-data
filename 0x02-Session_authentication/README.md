# 0x02-Session Authentication

## Description

This directory contains projects and exercises focused on session-based authentication mechanisms in backend development. The goal is to implement and manage user sessions securely, ensuring that authenticated users can maintain their sessions across multiple interactions with the application.

## Contents

- **0. Setup Session**: Initialize session management in the application.
- **1. User Session Model**: Define a user session model with necessary attributes.
- **2. Session Storage**: Implement storage for session data.
- **3. Create and Manage Sessions**: Create and manage user sessions during login.
- **4. Secure Session Handling**: Implement secure practices for session handling.
- **5. Validate Sessions**: Validate active sessions for user requests.
- **6. Logout**: Implement session termination for user logout.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of session-based authentication.
- Implement session management using user session models.
- Store and retrieve session data securely.
- Create, manage, and validate user sessions.
- Implement secure session handling practices to protect user data.
- Handle user logout and session termination.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Django
- **Tools**: Postman for API testing, Redis for session storage

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `0x02-Session_authentication` directory:

   ```sh
   cd 0x02-Session_authentication
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the database:

   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server and use Postman or a similar tool to interact with the endpoints.
2. Test session creation by logging in and storing session data.
3. Validate sessions by sending requests with session identifiers.
4. Handle user logout and ensure sessions are terminated properly.
