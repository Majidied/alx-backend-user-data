# 0x03-User Authentication Service

## Description

This directory contains projects and exercises focused on building a comprehensive user authentication service. The aim is to develop a robust and secure system for managing user authentication, including user registration, login, password management, and session handling.

## Contents

- **0. User Model**: Define the user model with attributes such as email, password, and session ID.
- **1. User Registration**: Implement user registration with input validation.
- **2. User Login**: Develop a login mechanism that validates user credentials.
- **3. Session Management**: Create and manage user sessions.
- **4. Password Reset**: Implement functionality for resetting user passwords.
- **5. Token-based Authentication**: Introduce token-based authentication for secure access.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles of user authentication and authorization.
- Implement user registration, login, and session management.
- Use token-based authentication to enhance security.
- Develop password reset mechanisms.
- Apply best practices for securing user data and managing authentication services.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Django
- **Databases**: SQLite, PostgreSQL
- **Tools**: Postman for API testing, Docker for containerization

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `0x03-user_authentication_service` directory:

   ```sh
   cd 0x03-user_authentication_service
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the database:

   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server and use Postman or a similar tool to interact with the API endpoints.
2. Test the user registration and login endpoints by sending requests with appropriate data.
3. Experiment with session management, password reset, and token-based authentication features.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /auth/register**: Register a new user
- **POST /auth/login**: Log in a user
- **POST /auth/logout**: Log out a user
- **POST /auth/reset_password**: Reset user password
- **POST /auth/token**: Generate authentication token
