# 0x01-Basic Authentication

## Description

This directory contains projects and exercises focused on the basics of user authentication in backend development. The goal is to understand and implement fundamental authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure access to resources.

## Contents

- **0. Simple Basic Authentication**: Implement a basic authentication mechanism.
- **1. User Model**: Define a user model with necessary attributes.
- **2. Storage**: Implement storage for user credentials.
- **3. Session Authentication**: Implement session-based authentication.
- **4. Hash Passwords**: Secure user passwords using hashing.
- **5. Validate User Credentials**: Validate user credentials during login.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concepts of basic and session-based authentication.
- Implement user models and secure storage for user credentials.
- Use hashing techniques to protect user passwords.
- Validate user credentials and manage authenticated sessions.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Django
- **Tools**: Postman for API testing, SQLite for database

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `0x01-Basic_authentication` directory:

   ```sh
   cd 0x01-Basic_authentication
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the database:

   ```sh

4. Run the application:

   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server and use Postman or a similar tool to interact with the endpoints.
2. Test the basic authentication mechanism by sending requests with appropriate headers.
3. Experiment with creating, storing, and validating user credentials.
